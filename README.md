ExtJSBundle
===========

The ExtJSBundle has various classes to make life easier when returning data to an ExtJS interface using Symfony2. At the moment its specifically designed to work with [FOSRestBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle)

Features include:

- **StoreView** Used to return a collection of objects and wrap them in the default properties that helps an ExtJS Store out.

**Caution:** This bundle is developed in sync with [symfony's repository](https://github.com/symfony/symfony). I have not tested this under Symfony 2.0.X
